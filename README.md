# odin-calculator
This is a simple calculator that was created as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. It utilizes a mixture of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, to replicate the functionality of a relatively simple calculator. It can evaluate only one expression at a time (i.e. it does not follow order of operations). It has all the basic operations of a calculator (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), along with functionality for decimals, squaring numbers, finding the square root of numbers, and determining the negative/positive of a number.
